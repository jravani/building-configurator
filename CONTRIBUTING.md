## Development Workflow

The exact setup steps may differ by project. Please check the `README.md` and project documentation for installation and development instructions.

### 1) Fork and clone the repository (if applicable)

If you do not have direct write access, fork the repository first, then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/THD-Spatial-AI/building-configurator.git
cd building-configurator
```

If you have direct write access, clone the main repository instead.

### 2) Create a branch for your change

Create a dedicated branch for your bugfix, feature, or documentation update:

```bash
git checkout -b type/short-description
```

Examples:

- `fix/login-validation`
- `feat/export-yaml`
- `docs/readme-setup`

### 3) Make your changes

Keep changes focused and small where possible. If your change is large, consider splitting it into multiple pull requests.

### 4) Test your changes (if applicable)

Before submitting a pull request:

- Run relevant tests
- Check linting/formatting tools (if used)
- Verify the project still builds/runs locally
- Update documentation if your change affects usage or behaviour

### 5) Commit your changes

Use clear commit messages that explain what changed.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Short summary of the change"
```

For larger changes, include a more descriptive commit message when needed.

### 6) Push your branch

```bash
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
```

### 7) Open a pull request

Create a pull request against the appropriate branch (usually `main` unless the project uses a different workflow).

In your pull request description, include:

- What changed
- Why it changed
- Any screenshots (for UI changes)
- Testing notes
- Related issue(s), if applicable (e.g. `Closes #123`)
