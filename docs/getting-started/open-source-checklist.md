# Open Source Readiness Checklist

Use this checklist before making a repository public under the **THD-Spatial** group.

This checklist is designed to be practical and easy to review. It separates **required**, **conditional**, and **recommended** items so you can focus on what matters first.

!!! warning

    Without files listed above, your repository does not meet the minimum requirements for public release under the **THD-Spatial** organization. Please complete all essential items before proceeding to make your repository public.
---

## Data Management (Required if applicable)

If your repository contains large files (e.g. datasets, binaries, media, generated assets), you must use Git LFS to manage them.

### Git LFS (Large File Storage)

Complete this section if your repository contains large files (e.g. datasets, binaries, media, generated assets).

- [ ] Git LFS installed locally
- [ ] Git LFS initialised in repository (`git lfs install`)
- [ ] Large file types tracked (e.g. data files, media, binaries)
- [ ] `.gitattributes` committed to repository
- [ ] Large files added and committed properly
- [ ] Release strategy for LFS files documented (if applicable)

> **Note:** Files tracked by Git LFS are not included in release assets by default.
> If needed, enable **Include Git LFS objects in archives** in repository settings.

---

## Attribution (Required if applicable)

If your project uses third-party components, assets, or generated code that require attribution (e.g. UI components from Figma, design systems, libraries under Apache 2.0, BSD, or CC BY licenses), include an `ATTRIBUTIONS.md` file.

### ATTRIBUTION

- [x] `ATTRIBUTIONS.md` file created in repository root
- [x] Third-party component or asset names listed
- [x] Source platform or author identified for each entry
- [x] License type specified for each entry
- [x] Links to original sources included
- [x] Any required attribution text preserved as-is from the original license/notice

!!! note

    If no third-party assets requiring attribution are used, this section can be skipped.

---

## Citation (Recommended for research projects)

If your project is related to research or uses open-source tools and data that should be cited, include a `CITATION.cff` file. GitHub automatically detects this file and shows a "Cite this repository" button on the repository page.

For full specification details, see [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/).

### CITATION.cff

- [x] `CITATION.cff` file created in repository root
- [x] `cff-version` set to `1.2.0`
- [x] Project title specified
- [x] At least one author listed (with name and affiliation)
- [x] ORCID included for each author (if available)
- [x] License field matches the repository `LICENSE` file
- [x] Repository URL included
- [x] Version and release date set
- [ ] File validates against the CFF schema (use [cff-validator](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cff-initializer-javascript))

!!! tip

    You can generate a `CITATION.cff` file interactively using the [CFF Initializer](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/).
