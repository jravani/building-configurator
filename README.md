# Building Configurator

[![MkDocs](https://github.com/THD-Spatial-AI/building-configurator/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://THD-Spatial-AI.github.io/building-configurator/)

A React component for modelling building properties within the [EnerPlanET](https://enerplanet.th-deg.de/) platform. It provides a reusable configuration interface for energy simulation workflows, including annual heat demand estimation (HDCP) and thermal load profiling (BUEM), with the intent to support additional simulation services over time.

## Features

- Configure building geometry, envelope elements, and thermal parameters
- Set up roof and photovoltaic (PV) system properties
- Visualise the building energy envelope and surface composition
- View simulated heating and cooling load profiles
- Step-by-step configuration workflow with live building snapshot

## Running the code

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
